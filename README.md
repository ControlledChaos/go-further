The following is not a complete list of options available in this theme, only a summary of those added to the options provided by the parent theme.

## Additional Design Styles

New design styles (font faces & color schemes) are added to the ones provided by the parent theme. The color scheme options of the parent remain untouched so you can continue using a design style and color scheme that you like.

## Admin Themes

Optionally apply design styles to administration screens. Fonts used are those of the active frontend style while that style's color schemes become user options on the profile edit screen. The default admin color scheme is the default color scheme of the active design style.

## Header Options

Two additional header layouts are provided, which eliminate the search icon. Any header layout can be made sticky.

## Subtitles

The manual excerpt of any post type is added as a subtitle, below the page title.

## Featured Images

A cover image template is provided for post types post, page, event, and product. This applies the post's featured image as a full-screen background image with title, subtitle, and header displayed over the image. A separate logo upload is provided for cover image overlay.

Featured images in the default template can be displayed full width, contained by the content padding, or manage on a per-post basis.

## Blog Options

Blog index pages can have a title, subtitle, and featured image. There are options for featured image display, including the cover image template on the first page of the blog.

## Widget Areas

The parent theme does not provide any widget areas. This child theme adds one or four widget areas below the main content. You can choose to use the classic widgets interface or block widgets. If classic widgets are used then four widget areas are registered and displayed as columns, although not all need to be used. If block widgets are used then only one widget area is registered because columns can be created as desired using layout blocks.

Custom color options are added for the widget area(s) but they do take on colors of the active color scheme if not overridden.

## Social Icons

CodePen is added to the list of available social site links.

Social icons can be hidden in the footer if you only want to display them in a header layout.

## Google Fonts

Optionally disable fetching font stylesheets from the Google API.
